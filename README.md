# violet24

## Our project for HackViolet 2024.
The goal of this project is to provide a way to practice interview questions focusing more on behavioural and knowledge, rather than programming. We see this as an alternative and supplement to LeetCode to better help people round-out their abilities to succeed in interviews. We hope this will help not just women, but everyone to better their skills and better secure jobs. 

## Project Integrations
This project uses React, Google Cloud, Docker, and Spring Boot.
